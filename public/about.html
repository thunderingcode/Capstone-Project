<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Lily Stone, and I believe in the power of combining technical skills with a human-centered, empathetic approach. One of the values I hold dear is the ability to build meaningful relationships with people—whether in a work environment, academic setting, or personal life.
  I enjoy balancing logical thinking and data analysis with soft skills, such as creating connections, listening, and understanding others’ needs. For me, success in a role is not only about meeting targets but also about creating positive experiences and making a lasting impact on those around me.</p>
  <p>As an Industrial Engineering and Management student, I am motivated to apply my academic knowledge to optimize processes and drive continuous improvement. I have a passion for solving complex problems and view lifelong learning as a core part of who I am.
  I love diving deep into new subjects, broadening my horizons, and keeping my knowledge up-to-date. One area of particular interest to me is organizational process optimization, as I understand that its impact extends beyond efficiency and productivity to include employee and customer satisfaction as well.</p>
  <p>Additionally, I believe that experiences outside of work, like traveling and exposure to diverse cultures, enrich the perspective I bring to any situation. These experiences provide me with the tools to understand people from various viewpoints and adapt quickly and naturally to changing circumstances.</p>
